    "Many of the excerises here are stright-forward in that the solutions require no more than a few lines of code (in pandas or NumPy... don't go using pure Python or Cython!). Choosing the right methods and following best practices is the underlying goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises are loosely divided in sections. Each section has a difficulty rating; these ratings are subjective, of course, but should be a seen as a rough guide as to how inventive the required solution is.\n",
