    "Inspired by [100 Numpy exerises](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100), here are 100* short puzzles for testing your knowledge of [pandas'](http://pandas.pydata.org/) power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since pandas is a large library with many different specialist features and functions, these excercises focus mainly on the fundamentals of manipulating data (indexing, grouping, aggregating, cleaning), making use of the core DataFrame and Series objects. \n",

    "Many of the excerises here are stright-forward in that the solutions require no more than a few lines of code (in pandas or NumPy... don't go using pure Python or Cython!). Choosing the right methods and following best practices is the underlying goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises are loosely divided in sections. Each section has a difficulty rating; these ratings are subjective, of course, but should be a seen as a rough guide as to how inventive the required solution is.\n",
